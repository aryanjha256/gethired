# Handoff

Short log of features shipped and caveats to know about. Newest on top.

## Fixed the build-blocking pre-existing errors (they were dismissed as harmless all session — they weren't)

- **What happened**: the first real Vercel deploy attempt failed at
  `next build`'s TypeScript step on `src/components/ui/spinner.tsx` — an
  error that had shown up in every single `npx tsc --noEmit` run this
  entire session and was repeatedly noted as "pre-existing, unrelated."
  That was true in the narrow sense (none of this session's changes caused
  it), but wrong in the sense that mattered: `next build` runs its own
  TypeScript and ESLint gates and fails the build on real errors, unlike
  a bare `tsc --noEmit` invocation that's easy to skim past in a terminal.
  All three pre-existing errors (`spinner.tsx`'s type error, plus the two
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` errors in `carousel.tsx` and
  `use-mobile.ts` that would very likely have blocked the *next* deploy
  attempt right after) are now actually fixed, not just noted.
- **`spinner.tsx`**: `React.ComponentProps<"svg">` types `strokeWidth` as
  `string | number`, but `HugeiconsIcon`'s own `strokeWidth` prop only
  accepts `number`. `Spinner` always hardcodes `strokeWidth={2}` itself —
  no caller overrides it (checked both usages) — so the fix is
  `Omit<React.ComponentProps<"svg">, "strokeWidth">` on the accepted props,
  not loosening `HugeiconsIcon`'s type.
- **`carousel.tsx`** and **`use-mobile.ts`**: both were the classic
  "derive React state from an external, event-emitting API via
  `useState` + `useEffect(() => setState(...))`" pattern — Embla's
  carousel `api` object in one case, `window.matchMedia` in the other.
  Rewritten using `React.useSyncExternalStore`, the primitive actually
  designed for "subscribe to an external mutable source, read a
  synchronized snapshot" — no effect-calling-setState involved at all, so
  there's nothing for the lint rule to flag. Behavior is unchanged in both
  cases (same events subscribed to, same derived boolean values, same SSR
  fallback of `false`).
- **Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` is now completely silent (first
  time all session), `npm run lint` reports 0 errors (down from 2, the
  remaining 5 are non-blocking warnings), and a full local
  `npm run build` succeeds end-to-end — the same build Vercel's pipeline
  runs.

## Vercel Cron backstop for the email queue

- **What**: `POST /api/emails/drain` was only ever triggered by the
  client-side polling loop (`useDrainEmailQueue`) or the one-shot `after()`
  head-start in `enqueueContactEmails` — meaning a batch could get stuck
  `queued` forever if the browser tab closed mid-drain and nothing else
  ever triggered a new send. `vercel.json` now schedules a cron hit against
  the same drain logic once a day (`0 3 * * *`, 3am UTC — Vercel's Hobby
  plan caps cron jobs at once per day, so an every-few-minutes schedule
  isn't available on this plan), independent of whether any tab is open.
  This doesn't change how the queue is stored (still the `emails` table)
  or how work gets claimed (still Postgres `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in
  `claimQueuedEmails`) — it's just a third, durable way to trigger the
  same executor that already existed. Worth being clear-eyed about what
  once-daily actually buys: it's not a tight-loop backstop, it's a "nothing
  stays stuck for more than ~24h" guarantee — a big improvement over no
  backstop at all, but the realistic day-to-day draining still happens via
  the client polling loop while a tab is open.
- **Security note surfaced along the way**: `src/proxy.ts`'s matcher
  excludes `/api` entirely (`(?!api|_next/static|...)`), so
  `/api/emails/drain` has always been a fully public, unauthenticated
  route — anyone who found the URL could already `POST` to it. Not
  introduced by this change, but since cron now also calls this route,
  the new `GET` handler (Vercel Cron always triggers via `GET`, never
  `POST`) checks `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` against a new
  `CRON_SECRET` env var, rejecting with 401 otherwise — the standard
  Vercel pattern for securing a cron-triggered route. The existing `POST`
  path (used by client polling) is still unauthenticated at the API layer;
  that's an existing gap, not addressed here.
- **Files**: `vercel.json` (new), `src/app/api/emails/drain/route.ts`
  (added `GET`, `POST` unchanged), `.env.example`/`.env.local`
  (`CRON_SECRET`).
- **Setup required**: `CRON_SECRET` must also be set as an env var on the
  actual Vercel project (not just `.env.local`) — Vercel then attaches it
  automatically to cron-triggered requests. If this project ever moves off
  the Hobby plan, `0 3 * * *` can be tightened to something more frequent
  (Pro allows arbitrary schedules, not just once-daily).

## Stale-match protection for inbox scanning

- **What**: a match is now dropped if the inbox message predates the most
  recent email actually sent to that contact. Addresses the concern that,
  especially during dev/testing (repeated sends + status resets to the
  same test contact), a stale reply/bounce still sitting inside the
  30-day scan window could re-match after a contact's status was reset —
  since the scan previously had no memory of what it had already
  considered, only "does this contact's current status make it eligible."
- **Why not Message-ID threading instead**: that would solve this too, but
  needs a schema change (`emails.messageId`), parsing `In-Reply-To` off
  replies, and — for bounces — locating a second embedded MIME part inside
  the DSN to recover the original message's Message-ID. The actual problem
  here doesn't need precise per-email correlation, just "is this newer
  than the last thing we sent" — a plain date comparison, no schema change.
- **Files**:
  - `src/lib/mailbox.ts` — `scanInbox()`'s return type changed from
    `Set<string>` to `Map<string, Date | undefined>` for both
    `repliedAddresses`/`bouncedAddresses`, keeping the *latest* message
    date seen per address (`keepLatest()`). Threaded through all three
    fetch passes: reply dates come straight off Pass 1's envelope; bounce
    dates are captured in Pass 1 (`bounceCandidateDates`, keyed by uid,
    since Pass 1 is the only pass that fetches envelope) and matched back
    up to the extracted address in Pass 3.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts` — `previewInboxMatches()` now also
    queries `max(emails.created_at)` grouped by `contactId` (`status =
    'sent'` only) to get each contact's last-sent timestamp, and an
    `isFreshMatch()` check requires the matched message's date to be
    *after* that.
- **Corrected after further discussion**: the first version of
  `isFreshMatch()` *allowed* a match through when there was no `sent` row
  for the contact at all ("no baseline to compare against"). That's
  backwards for this app's actual dev workflow — `contacts.id` is a fresh
  UUID on every import, so a contact re-imported after the DB is
  wiped/reset for testing always starts with zero `emails` history, no
  matter how many times that same address was emailed before the reset.
  The permissive default meant a stale inbox message could immediately
  mismatch onto a freshly re-imported contact — worst case for bounces
  specifically, since bounce-matching (unlike replies) doesn't require the
  contact to already be `contacted`/`followed_up`, so a brand-new `status:
  "new"` import could get wrongly marked `bounced` on the very first
  "Check for replies" click. Flipped to the opposite default: no `sent` row
  for this contact row means nothing to correlate the message to, so the
  match is dropped. Known trade-off, stated plainly: a contact whose only
  send attempt genuinely failed (`emails.status` stuck at `"failed"`, never
  reaching `"sent"`) can never match a reply/bounce either, even if one
  legitimately arrives — accepted as reasonable, since this app never
  actually confirmed sending them anything in the first place.

## Constrained status transitions + confirm-before-apply for inbox matches

- **What**: two gaps closed together. (1) The inline status `Select` on
  `/contacts` used to let any contact jump to any other status
  (`closed` → `new`, `bounced` → `interviewing`, anything) — now each
  status only offers its logical next steps, matching the lifecycle logic
  already assumed everywhere else in this app. (2) "Check for replies"
  used to scan the inbox and immediately write `replied`/`bounced` status
  changes with zero review step — it now shows a confirmation dialog
  listing exactly which contacts matched and what they'd become, and only
  writes anything once you click Apply.
- **Status transitions** (`src/lib/contacts.ts`):
  `ALLOWED_STATUS_TRANSITIONS` (a `Record<status, status[]>`) plus
  `getSelectableStatuses(current)` (returns `current` + its allowed next
  statuses, filtered from `CONTACT_STATUSES` — feeds both the `Select`'s
  `items` prop and its `SelectContent` children in
  `src/app/(app)/contacts/contacts-table.tsx`). `closed` is reachable from
  every non-closed status (the universal "give up" escape hatch);
  `no_opening`'s only manual forward move is `closed` — its actual
  re-eligibility for a fresh `initial` send is already automatic via the
  company cooldown, not something a manual status change should trigger.
  **Enforced server-side too**, not just in the `Select`'s options:
  `updateContactStatus` (`src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts`) now fetches
  the contact's current status first, throws if the requested status isn't
  in `ALLOWED_STATUS_TRANSITIONS[current]`, and only then applies the
  update guarded by `WHERE status = <status just read>` — same
  read-then-guarded-write pattern already used for the automatic
  `contacted`/`followed_up` advances in `enqueueContactEmails`. The client
  restriction is UX; this is where the rule is actually authoritative.
- **Confirm-before-apply**: `checkForReplies()` is gone, split into
  `previewInboxMatches()` (runs `scanInbox()` + the same matching logic as
  before, returns the matches instead of writing them) and
  `applyInboxMatches(matches)` (the actual bulk updates, called only when
  the user clicks Apply). New
  `src/app/(app)/contacts/inbox-matches-dialog.tsx` shows the match list —
  same capped-height `Dialog` + `ScrollArea` pattern as
  `send-email-dialog.tsx` (header/footer pinned, only the list scrolls).
  No per-row include/exclude checkboxes — Apply commits the whole batch,
  Cancel discards it.
- **Files**: `src/lib/contacts.ts`, `src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts`,
  `src/app/(app)/contacts/contacts-table.tsx`,
  `src/app/(app)/contacts/inbox-matches-dialog.tsx` (new).
- **Explicitly deferred**: no per-row selection inside the confirmation
  dialog (whole-batch Apply/Cancel only); no change to the IMAP matching
  heuristics themselves, this was purely about what happens after matches
  are found and about constraining manual edits.

## Auto-detect replies AND bounces via IMAP ("Check for replies")

- **Correctness improvement**: `extractBouncedAddress` (`src/lib/mailbox.ts`)
  now reads the DSN's `Action:` field and only treats `Action: failed` as a
  real bounce — `Action: delayed` (Gmail still retrying, not a permanent
  failure) no longer gets misreported as `bounced`. Same downloaded
  delivery-status text we already parse for `Final-Recipient`, just one
  more regex — no schema change, no new file.
- **Fixed after initial ship (2nd round)**: bounce classification in
  `scanInbox()` (`src/lib/mailbox.ts`) originally OR'd a sender check
  (`mailer-daemon`/`postmaster`) with a subject regex
  (`delivery failure|undelivered|returned mail|...`). That subject regex is
  exactly the wording that shows up in a normal inbox's years of unrelated
  e-commerce/shipping emails ("Your delivery failed, we'll retry", "Item
  undelivered"). Every false-positive match still paid for the expensive
  part — a real `bodyStructure` fetch plus a sequential, awaited
  `download()` — before finding no `message/delivery-status` part and
  giving up. That's what made "Check for replies" noticeably slower after
  bounce detection was added, scaling with however many unrelated
  "delivery"/"failure"-worded emails happened to be in the 30-day window.
  Fixed by dropping the subject check entirely — every bounce this app will
  ever see is relayed through Gmail's own `mailer-daemon@` address (a
  strict, universal MTA convention), so the sender check alone is both
  sufficient and precise, with no false-positive cost.
- **Fixed after initial ship (1st round)**: the first version of `scanInbox()` called
  `client.download()` (for the bounce delivery-status part) *from inside*
  the `for await` loop still consuming `client.fetch()`'s results —
  issuing a second IMAP command while the first was still streaming. That
  caused a 500 and a ~5 minute hang on a single scan. Fixed by splitting
  into three fully-sequential passes in `src/lib/mailbox.ts`: (1) envelope
  only, for every message in the window, to classify bounce-shaped vs.
  everything else; (2) `bodyStructure` only for the small bounce-shaped
  subset; (3) `download()` per candidate — each pass's `for await` loop
  fully drains before the next command is issued. This also fixed a real
  performance problem beyond the interleaving bug: the original version
  fetched `bodyStructure` for *every* message in the 30-day window, not
  just bounce candidates, which is unnecessarily heavy on a real inbox
  with hundreds of unrelated emails in that period.
- **What**: one button on `/contacts` ("Check for replies", next to "Send
  Email", not tied to row selection) now detects both outcomes in a single
  inbox scan: a real reply flips a contact to `replied`; a genuine bounce
  notice flips it to `bounced`. `contacted`/`followed_up` were already
  fully automatic (advance synchronously at enqueue time) — this closes
  the other two manual-tracking gaps that don't scale at 50–100 sends/day.
  Bounce detection was originally deferred as "too inconsistent to parse
  reliably," but that concern turned out to be about *other* providers'
  bounce formats — Gmail's own bounces (which is what actually lands in
  this inbox, regardless of who rejected the message) are consistent RFC
  3464 DSNs, which made this tractable without a second package.
- **Why IMAP, and why it's safe re: architecture**: this app is SMTP-only
  (send). Gmail app passwords work for both SMTP and IMAP, so this reuses
  the existing `SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASSWORD` — no new provider, no new
  credential type, just IMAP host/port added.
- **Matching heuristic — deliberately simple, and deliberately not using
  Message-ID**: no Message-ID/In-Reply-To threading for either replies or
  bounces. For replies, plain `From`-address matching against
  `contacts.email` already works with no reported false positives, scoped
  to contacts currently `contacted`/`followed_up` (self-limiting on repeat
  checks — a contact who flips to `replied` falls out of that set). For
  bounces, Gmail's bounce DSN already hands us the failed address directly
  via its `Final-Recipient: rfc822;<address>` field inside the standard
  `message/delivery-status` MIME part — no need to correlate back to a
  specific sent message at all, so there was never a reason to add an
  `emails.messageId` column for this.
- **Known trade-off**: bounce-matching excludes only `closed`/`bounced`
  contacts, not `interviewing`/`replied` — if an already-engaged contact's
  address somehow bounces on a later send, this would overwrite that more
  valuable status with `bounced`. Accepted as unlikely in practice (you're
  not sending automated cold outreach to someone you're already
  interviewing with).
- **Files**:
  - `src/lib/mailbox.ts` — `scanInbox()` (replaces the earlier
    `findRecentInboxSenders()`). Same connect/lock/search-last-30-days
    shape as before, but now fetches `bodyStructure` alongside `envelope`
    in the same pass and classifies each message: sender/subject matching
    `BOUNCE_SENDER_PATTERN`/`BOUNCE_SUBJECT_PATTERN` → bounce candidate
    (never also counted as a reply); everything else → reply candidate.
    `findDeliveryStatusPart()` recurses `bodyStructure.childNodes` for the
    `message/delivery-status` node; `extractBouncedAddress()` downloads
    just that one MIME part via `client.download(uid, part, { uid: true
    })`, reads it with the built-in `node:stream/consumers` `text()`
    helper (no new dependency), and regexes out `Final-Recipient`.
    Best-effort throughout — a message with no such part is silently
    skipped, not an error.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts` — `checkForReplies()` (name kept
    as-is; the button already called it, no reason to rename what's
    otherwise unchanged from the caller's side) now pulls `status` for
    every contact once, filters in plain JS into `repliedIds`/`bouncedIds`
    (a contact can't land in both — `bouncedIds` explicitly excludes
    anything already in `repliedIds`), and issues one bulk update per
    outcome. Returns `{ repliedCount, bouncedCount }`.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/contacts-table.tsx` — toast now reports both
    counts (e.g. "2 replied, 1 bounced"), same
    toast-then-`router.refresh()` pattern as `handleStatusChange`.
  - `.env.example` / `.env.local` — `IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com`,
    `IMAP_PORT=993` (added when the reply-only version first shipped,
    unchanged here).
- **Setup required**: `npm install imapflow` already run (verified: no new
  vulnerabilities beyond this project's existing pre-accepted ones —
  esbuild/drizzle-kit, postcss/next, xlsx). **Gmail also requires IMAP to be
  turned on separately** in Gmail Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP — an
  app password alone doesn't enable IMAP access. (In practice this worked
  even before that setting was toggled — likely because app-password API
  access isn't gated the same way a full IMAP client sync is — but the
  setting is still the documented/supported path.)
- **Explicitly deferred**: fallback bounce-address extraction beyond the
  standard `message/delivery-status` part (e.g. parsing the embedded
  original message's `To:` header when a bounce is non-standard); any
  automatic/scheduled trigger (this app has no background worker or cron —
  manual button only); a persisted "last checked" timestamp (each check
  just re-scans a fixed 30-day window, which is simpler and already safe
  against re-matching on repeat runs).

## Theme toggle

- **What**: `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx` — a Light/Dark/System dropdown
  in the sidebar footer, just above Settings. `ThemeProvider`/`next-themes`
  were already wired up in the root layout (`attribute="class"`,
  `enableSystem`) and every color token already has dark-mode values in
  `globals.css` — this was the one missing piece (nothing to actually
  trigger a theme change).
- **Files**: `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx` (new) — a `DropdownMenu`
  triggered by a `SidebarMenuButton` (so it matches every other sidebar
  item's look/tooltip-when-collapsed behavior), three items calling
  `setTheme()` from `next-themes`. `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` — added
  `<ThemeToggle />` as the first item in the footer `SidebarMenu`, before
  the Settings entry.
- **Caveat worth knowing**: deliberately did **not** use the common
  "mounted-guard + `useEffect(() => setMounted(true), [])`" pattern most
  shadcn theme-toggle examples use to avoid a hydration mismatch on the
  icon — that's a synchronous `setState` inside an effect, a pattern this
  repo's React Compiler lint already flags as an error elsewhere
  (`use-mobile.ts`, `carousel.tsx`), and adding a fresh instance of it
  seemed wrong to introduce knowingly. Instead this just reads
  `const { theme = "light" } = useTheme()` directly, matching the existing
  convention already in `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`. Trade-off: on a
  visit where the resolved theme differs from the `"light"` default (e.g.
  system preference is dark, or the user previously chose Dark), the sidebar
  icon may show the wrong theme's icon for one frame before Next re-renders
  with the real value — cosmetic only, not a layout shift or hydration
  *error*, just a fallback default label opportunity if it's ever noticeable
  in practice.

## Templates and Test Email promoted out of Settings

- **What**: `/settings` was an index page linking out to three sub-pages
  (Sender Identity, Templates, Test Email) — that index-of-links pattern is
  gone. Templates and Test Email are now first-class sidebar items with
  their own top-level routes; `/settings` itself directly shows what used
  to live at `/settings/sender` (name/signature/cooldown), no more
  click-through needed.
- **Route changes**: `/settings/templates` → `/templates` (and its
  `/new`, `/[id]/edit` children moved with it), `/settings/test-email` →
  `/test-email`, `/settings/sender` folded into `/settings` directly (its
  `page.tsx`/`actions.ts`/`sender-identity-form.tsx` moved up one level,
  `settings-link-card.tsx` deleted — nothing links to it anymore since the
  index page it existed for is gone).
- **Files**: pure moves, only the path strings inside them changed
  (`redirect`/`revalidatePath` calls in `templates/actions.ts` and the
  `Link href`s in `templates/page.tsx` updated from `/settings/templates/...`
  to `/templates/...`; `settings/actions.ts`'s `revalidatePath` updated from
  `/settings/sender` to `/settings`). No relative imports needed touching —
  every moved page already imported its siblings with relative paths
  (`./template-form`, `../template-form`, etc.) at the same relative depth.
  `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` gained "Templates" (`NoteEditIcon`) and
  "Test Email" (`MailSend01Icon`) entries in `navMain`.
- **Setup required**: none — no schema/data changes, just moved files and
  updated hardcoded path strings.

## Dashboard charts

- **What**: replaced the plain "Contacts by status" count list with a
  horizontal bar chart, and added a new "Emails sent (last 14 days)" trend
  chart above it. Two different chart stacks, deliberately: the status
  breakdown is a single-series magnitude comparison across 8 categories
  (textbook bar chart), so it uses the plain `components/ui/chart.tsx` +
  recharts `BarChart` directly — no new component needed, and it keeps that
  section visually restrained rather than reaching for evilcharts' more
  elaborate look everywhere. The trend chart is genuinely a time-series, so
  it reuses `EvilAreaChart` (already fully built in
  `src/components/evilcharts/charts/area-chart.tsx` from an earlier
  install) — first real usage of it anywhere in the app.
- **Files**:
  - `src/lib/dashboard.ts` — `buildStatusChartData` (maps grouped status
    counts onto every `CONTACT_STATUSES` entry, defaulting missing ones to
    0) and `buildDailySendCounts` (buckets a list of send timestamps into
    one row per day over a fixed window, zero-filling days with no sends).
    Both are plain camelCase functions, not components — `buildDailySendCounts`
    calls `new Date()` internally, and doing that inline in `page.tsx`'s
    `DashboardPage` function body directly would trip this project's React
    Compiler purity lint (it flags `Date.now()`/`new Date()` in anything
    shaped like a component, same issue hit and fixed the same way on the
    Companies page's cooldown math).
  - `src/app/(app)/status-bar-chart.tsx` — client component, `layout="vertical"`
    (horizontal bars) so the longer status labels like "Followed Up" don't
    need to rotate. Single flat color (`var(--chart-1)`, one of this app's
    existing chart CSS variables) rather than one hue per bar — it's one
    series (count), so per this app's dataviz convention color shouldn't
    imply identity that isn't there; bar length + labels already carry the
    comparison.
  - `src/app/(app)/emails-trend-chart.tsx` — client component wrapping
    `EvilAreaChart` with a single `sent` series, same `var(--chart-1)` color
    for both light/dark (that CSS variable already has identical light/dark
    values in `globals.css`).
  - `src/app/(app)/page.tsx` — added the 14-day window query (`emails`
    filtered to `status = 'sent'` and `created_at >= now() - interval '1
    day' * 14`, filter computed entirely in SQL so no JS `Date` math needed
    in the query itself), run alongside the existing stat queries via the
    same `Promise.all`.
- **Setup required**: none — `recharts` and `motion` were already
  dependencies (the evilcharts area chart pulled them in previously), and
  the chart color CSS variables (`--chart-1`..`--chart-5`) already existed
  in `globals.css`. No new packages.
- **Explicitly deferred**: no date-range picker (14 days is a fixed
  constant, `TREND_DAYS` in `page.tsx`) — matches the dashboard's existing
  "no filtering yet" caveat. Only one evilcharts chart type is vendored
  (area); no bar/pie/radar evilcharts variant was added, since the plain
  shadcn bar chart was the better fit for the one categorical use case that
  came up.

## Companies page + schema audit fixes; sidebar cleanup

- **What**: `/` (previously a `<div>HomePage</div>` stub) is now a real
  overview: 4 stat tiles (Contacts, Companies, Interviewing, Failed sends),
  a "Contacts by status" breakdown using the existing `CONTACT_STATUSES`
  order/labels from `src/lib/contacts.ts` (so it can't drift out of sync
  with the enum), and a "Recent activity" list of the last 8 `emails` rows
  (recipient, subject, company, status badge). Plain stat cards, no charts —
  matches this app's existing minimal/Linear-ish visual direction, nothing
  new to justify a charting library.
- **Files**: `src/app/(app)/page.tsx` only — one query per stat, all run via
  `Promise.all` (independent aggregates, no reason to serialize them), plus
  one join for recent activity. Small local `StatCard` presentational
  component defined in the same file (only used here, didn't warrant its
  own file).
- **Explicitly deferred**: no date-range filtering (e.g. "this week" vs
  all-time) on any of the stats — everything shown is an all-time total or
  current snapshot. No links from the stat tiles/status rows to a
  pre-filtered `/contacts` view yet (same gap noted on the Companies page —
  `DataTable` has no initial-filter prop today).

## Companies page + schema audit fixes; sidebar cleanup

- **What**: two things bundled from the same review pass:
  1. Fixed a regression from the previous change: the company-wide cooldown
     was blocking *every* send (including follow-ups to contacts already
     mid-conversation), not just fresh outreach. Now it only blocks sending
     to a contact who is themselves `new`/`no_opening` — a rejection from
     one contact at a company no longer freezes an unrelated,
     already-in-progress thread with someone else there.
  2. Added `companies.domain` (nullable, unique) — the intended primary
     signal for "is this the same company" (derived from `contacts.email`,
     which is already `notNull().unique()`), to eventually replace/augment
     the existing normalized-company-name matching at import time. This
     round only added the column; the actual domain-based matching logic in
     `import/actions.ts` (with a free-email-provider blocklist so
     `gmail.com`/`yahoo.com`/etc. don't get treated as a single "company")
     is still to be implemented.
  3. New `/companies` page — read-only overview (name, domain, contact
     count, an "Interviewing" or "Cooldown (Nd left)" badge). No bulk
     actions, since companies are never emailed directly. Sidebar trimmed:
     removed `Applications`/`Interviews`/`Saved Jobs` (dead links — no page
     ever existed for any of them) and `Emails` (redundant with the existing
     "Send Email" dialog on `/contacts` — same recipients-plus-template
     flow, just a second surface for the same thing). Sidebar is now just
     Dashboard, Contacts, Companies, Import, Settings.
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts` — cooldown check now gated on
    `INITIAL_ELIGIBLE_STATUSES.includes(contact.status)` before checking
    `cooldownActive`, instead of applying unconditionally to every contact.
  - `src/db/schema.ts` — `companies.domain`.
  - `src/app/(app)/companies/{page,companies-table}.tsx` — new. Contact
    count and interviewing count come from one grouped query
    (`leftJoin(contacts)` + `count(*) filter (where status = 'interviewing')`);
    cooldown days-left is computed server-side in `page.tsx` via the new
    `computeCooldownDaysLeft()` in `src/lib/contacts.ts` and passed down as a
    plain number — deliberately not computed inside the client table's
    render, since calling `Date.now()` directly in a component body trips
    this project's React Compiler purity lint.
  - `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` — trimmed `navMain` to
    Dashboard/Contacts/Companies/Import; also dropped several
    already-unused imports (`SidebarGroupLabel`, `SidebarHeader`, `Image`)
    that predated this change.
  - `src/app/(app)/emails/` — deleted entirely (page + compose form). No
    other file imported from it except the now-removed sidebar entry.
- **Setup required**: `npm run db:push` already run (adds `companies.domain`
  as nullable+unique — existing 10 companies rows are untouched, still
  `NULL`, since nothing backfills it yet).
- **Explicitly deferred**: the domain-based company-matching logic itself
  (blocklist of free email providers, lookup-by-domain-first at import time,
  falling back to name-matching for free-domain contacts) — schema is ready
  for it but `import/actions.ts` hasn't been touched yet. Also deferred:
  clicking a company row doesn't jump to a filtered `/contacts` view yet (no
  initial-filter prop exists on the shared `DataTable` today) — you'd need
  to type the company name into the existing text filter on `/contacts`
  manually for now.

## Closed the resend/spam gap in the send queue

- **What**: fixed a real correctness bug in the queue design shipped just
  before this: because sending had become async (enqueue instantly, actual
  send happens later during drain), `contacts.status` didn't advance until
  the drain completed. Re-selecting the same contacts and hitting "Send"
  again a few seconds later — before that first batch had drained — would
  still see the old status and happily queue a duplicate "initial" email.
  Also, choosing "None"/a `thank_you`/`custom` template bypassed every
  sequencing rule entirely, so repeatedly sending that way was never
  checked or blocked at all.
- **Fixes** (`src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts`, `src/lib/email-queue.ts`,
  `src/db/schema.ts`, `src/lib/contacts.ts`):
  - `enqueueContactEmails` now advances `contacts.status` **synchronously**,
    per contact, the instant it decides to queue that contact's email — not
    later when the drain actually sends it. A second enqueue call, even 1ms
    later, already sees the updated status and skips. The update is guarded
    by the same eligible-statuses `WHERE` check (e.g. `status IN ('new',
    'no_opening')`) so a concurrent manual status change is never
    clobbered. If the send later fails during drain, status is **not**
    rolled back — an attempt was still made, which is what matters for not
    re-spamming; retrying is a deliberate manual status reset.
  - `email-queue.ts`'s `drainEmailQueue` no longer touches `contacts` at all
    (the `advanceContactStatus` helper was removed) — it's now purely "send
    what's queued," since status changes happen entirely at enqueue time.
  - The cooldown check and a new `ALWAYS_BLOCKED_STATUSES` check
    (`closed`, `bounced`) now apply to **every** send, including
    `thank_you`/`custom`/no-template ones — the sequencing rules can no
    longer be routed around by just not picking a template. Deliberately did
    **not** add `replied`/`interviewing` to that blocked list — those are
    live conversations where you'd still want to send a scheduling note or
    similar through this tool, so only `closed`/`bounced` (truly "don't
    contact again") block everything.
  - Added `"bounced"` as a `contacts.status` enum value (schema + it's now
    manually settable via the same inline status `Select` used for every
    other status — no bounce/inbox-reading was built, since this app has no
    IMAP/webhook access to the mailbox; a bounce is something you notice in
    your own inbox and reflect here manually). Unlike `no_opening`, marking
    `bounced` does **not** touch `companies.noOpeningAt` — a bounced address
    is a dead-contact problem, not a company-level "no opening" signal.
- **Setup required**: `npm run db:push` already run (adds the `bounced`
  enum value via `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`, no data loss).
- **Still not addressed**: `emails.status: "sent"` still only means "SMTP
  accepted it," not "delivered" — there's no automatic bounce detection
  (would require reading the sending mailbox via IMAP or a provider
  webhook, a materially bigger feature than this app's SMTP+app-password
  setup supports today). Marking a contact `bounced` is still a fully
  manual action you take after noticing the bounce yourself.

## Status enums, real send queue, and company-level cooldown/interview tracking

- **What**: `contacts.status`, `templates.type`, and `emails.status` are now
  real Postgres enums instead of unvalidated `text`. Bulk sending is no
  longer a blocking sequential loop — it's a DB-backed queue: "Send Email"
  now enqueues (fast, one bulk insert) and a separate drain step actually
  sends, so closing the tab mid-batch is safe and a second concurrent drain
  can never double-send the same email. Contact status also now models the
  full outreach lifecycle (`new → contacted → followed_up → replied →
  interviewing | no_opening | closed`), is manually editable inline in the
  contacts table, and drives two new business rules: (1) sending an
  `initial` template to an already-contacted person, or a `follow_up` to
  someone never contacted, is silently skipped; (2) marking a contact
  `no_opening` puts that contact's **whole company** on a cooldown (default
  45 days, configurable) during which no fresh `initial` goes to *any*
  contact there — the idea being not to hit the same company again so soon
  through a different person. A contact reaching `interviewing` shows a
  small badge next to that company's other rows in `/contacts` (informational
  only, nothing is auto-blocked by it).
- **Files**:
  - `src/db/schema.ts` — `contactStatusEnum`, `templateTypeEnum`,
    `emailStatusEnum` (`pgEnum`, replacing the old free-`text` columns);
    `companies.noOpeningAt` (nullable timestamp, set/reset whenever any
    contact there is marked `no_opening`); `appSettings.retryCooldownDays`
    (`integer default 45`); `emails.status` gained `"queued"`/`"sending"`
    states (default now `"queued"` instead of no default).
  - `src/lib/email-queue.ts` — the queue core. `claimQueuedEmails` atomically
    claims a batch via `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP
    LOCKED)` (raw SQL through `db.execute`, since Drizzle has no query
    builder API for `SKIP LOCKED`) so two drains racing never claim the same
    row. `drainEmailQueue` sends each claimed row through the existing
    `sendMail` (unchanged, still one pooled nodemailer transporter — no new
    concurrency/rate-limit work needed there), and on success calls
    `advanceContactStatus` (`initial` → `contacted`, `follow_up` →
    `followed_up`, guarded by a `WHERE status IN (...)` so a status changed
    manually in the meantime is never clobbered).
  - `src/app/api/emails/drain/route.ts` — the app's first Route Handler.
    `POST` runs one `drainEmailQueue` batch (limit 5) and returns
    `{ processed, remainingQueued }`. This is what the client polls.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts` — `sendContactEmails` renamed to
    `enqueueContactEmails` (both call sites updated): resolves targets,
    applies the initial/follow_up eligibility + cooldown rules, renders
    per-contact subject/body up front same as before, bulk-inserts
    `status: "queued"` rows, then fires `after(() => drainEmailQueue(...))`
    (this Next.js fork's `next/server` `after()`) as a best-effort immediate
    head start — not depended on for correctness, since the client poll is
    the durable path. Returns `{ queued, skippedNoMatch,
    skippedSequenceMismatch, skippedCompanyCooldown }` instead of the old
    `{ sent, failed, skipped }`, since sending is no longer synchronous with
    the request. Also added `updateContactStatus`, which sets
    `companies.noOpeningAt` when the new status is `no_opening`.
  - `src/hooks/use-drain-email-queue.ts` — shared client hook, `POST`s the
    drain endpoint every ~1.5s until `remainingQueued` hits 0. Used by both
    `ContactsTable` (owns it at that level, not inside the dialog, so polling
    survives the dialog closing) and `ComposeEmail` on `/emails`.
  - `src/lib/contacts.ts` — `CONTACT_STATUSES`/`contactStatusLabel` (mirrors
    the existing `TEMPLATE_TYPES` pattern in `templates.ts`) plus
    `describeEnqueueResult`, the shared toast-copy helper for both send
    surfaces.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/contacts-table.tsx` — status cell is now a
    `Select` (was a read-only `Badge`) wired to `updateContactStatus` +
    `router.refresh()`; company cell shows an "Interviewing" badge when that
    row's `companyId` is in the interviewing set computed on the page.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/page.tsx` — added the `companyId` select field
    and a `select distinct companyId from contacts where status =
    'interviewing'` query feeding the badge above.
  - `src/app/(app)/settings/sender/*` — the existing singleton settings page
    gained a third field, "Retry cooldown (days)", rather than a new page.
- **Setup required**: `npm run db:push` already run (confirmed the three
  `text→enum` column conversions applied cleanly against existing data —
  every existing value was already a valid enum member, so no data loss).
- **Explicitly deferred**: no retry/backoff for `failed` rows (still exactly
  one attempt); no message threading; no `"select"` filter variant for the
  Status column (still a plain text filter); polling reports an aggregate
  `remainingQueued` across the whole table, not scoped to the batch just
  submitted (fine at single-user scale); no auto-blocking of sends to a
  company's other contacts once one is `interviewing` (badge only); no
  dedicated `/companies` page — the interviewing flag and cooldown both live
  entirely inside the existing `/contacts` view.

## Email templates with per-recipient variables

- **What**: reusable email templates (Settings → Templates) with `{{variable}}`
  placeholders (`{{firstName}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{myName}}`,
  `{{signature}}`, etc.) that get resolved **per recipient** at send time — not
  once for the whole batch. Both existing send surfaces (the bulk "Send Email"
  dialog on `/contacts` and the `/emails` composer) gained a "Template" picker
  that pre-fills Subject/Body with the raw template text (still editable);
  choosing "None" preserves the old fully-manual behavior exactly.
- **New Settings → Sender Identity** page (`/settings/sender`): your display
  name + a signature block, stored in a singleton `app_settings` row, used only
  to resolve `{{myName}}`/`{{signature}}` — unrelated to `SMTP_FROM_NAME` (that's
  still just the SMTP transport's From header).
- **Files**:
  - `src/db/schema.ts` — new `templates` table (name/type/subject/body; `type`
    is free `text`, validated against `TEMPLATE_TYPES` at the app layer, same
    convention as `contacts.status`), new singleton `app_settings` table (fixed
    `id: "singleton"` PK — writes are always a single `insert().onConflictDoUpdate()`,
    no fetch-then-branch), and a nullable `emails.templateId` FK
    (`onDelete: "set null"` — deleting a template that was used to send doesn't
    break its log entry, just nulls the reference).
  - `src/lib/templates.ts` — the single source of truth for variables:
    `TEMPLATE_VARIABLES` (key/label/resolve), `renderTemplate(text, ctx)`
    (regex `{{key}}` replace, unknown keys left as-is), `TEMPLATE_TYPES`,
    `SAMPLE_TEMPLATE_CONTEXT` (fixed sample data for the editor's live preview).
    Plain TS, no directives — the same function resolves both the editor's
    preview and the real per-recipient substitution at send time, so they can't
    drift apart.
  - `src/app/(app)/contacts/actions.ts` — `sendContactEmails` now joins
    `companies` (for `{{company}}`, which it didn't fetch before), loads the
    `app_settings` singleton once (not per-contact), and renders subject/body
    per contact before sending/logging. Logs the **rendered** text per contact,
    not the raw template — the log should show what that specific person
    actually received. Gained an optional 4th `templateId` param, fully
    backward compatible (existing calls with no `{{...}}` in the text are a
    no-op through `renderTemplate`).
  - `src/app/(app)/settings/templates/` — `page.tsx` (list, plain `Card`s not
    `DataTable` — overkill for a short list), `template-form.tsx` (shared
    create/edit form: RHF for name/subject/body, plain `useState` for the type
    `Select` — this app has zero `Controller` usage anywhere, so followed the
    existing "local state merged in at submit" convention from
    `emails/compose-email.tsx` instead of introducing `Controller`; variable
    buttons insert `{{key}}` at the end of whichever field was last focused —
    no cursor/selection-range tracking, not worth it for short subject/body
    text; side-by-side live preview, no `Tabs` since that component has zero
    usage anywhere else yet), `new/page.tsx` + `[id]/edit/page.tsx` (this app's
    first dynamic route segment), `delete-template-button.tsx` (wraps the
    existing `alert-dialog.tsx`).
  - `src/app/(app)/settings/templates/actions.ts` — `createTemplate`/`updateTemplate`
    `redirect()` back to the list (matching this app's actual existing
    convention: mutate-then-navigate-to-a-fresh-route); `deleteTemplate` is the
    **only** one of the three that calls `revalidatePath` — it's triggered from
    the list page itself with no navigation, the first use of `revalidatePath`
    anywhere in this app.
  - `src/components/template-picker.tsx` — the shared `Select` used by both
    send surfaces (`"none"` sentinel value, not `""` — empty string as an item
    value is a footgun in select-like components generally).
  - `src/app/(app)/settings/settings-link-card.tsx` — extracted the repeated
    link-`Card` markup from `/settings` (was about to triple it with two new
    entries).
- **Setup required**: `npm run db:push` already run as part of this change
  (purely additive — two new tables, one nullable column, no data loss).
- **Explicitly deferred**: template `type` is purely organizational (no
  auto-selection based on `contact.status` or anything else); preview in the
  editor is against one fixed sample contact only, not a per-recipient preview
  list before sending; still plain text, no HTML templates; no template
  versioning or duplicate-send/cooldown prevention (already deferred earlier
  for a different reason, see the Contacts section below).

## Single-account auth gate (Clerk + Google OAuth, custom UI)

- **What**: the app is now single-tenant behind auth. Anyone can sign in via Google, but only the email in `ALLOWED_EMAIL` (`.env.local`) can actually reach the app — everyone else lands on a "not authorized" screen. No Clerk-branded UI anywhere (no `<SignIn>`/`<SignUp>`/`<UserButton>`); sign-in and the user menu are custom shadcn components driven by Clerk's headless hooks.
- **Why this shape**: checked this Clerk instance's live config (`/v1/environment` on its Frontend API) — `email_address` identification is off and `oauth_google` is the only enabled first factor. So "sign in" and "sign up" are the same Google button; Clerk auto-creates the account on first login. Gating happens *after* auth, not by restricting who can sign up.
- **This Next.js fork renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`** (see `node_modules/next/dist/docs/.../proxy.md`) — that's why the gate lives in `src/proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`.
- **Files**:
  - `src/proxy.ts` — `clerkMiddleware` wrapping every route except `_next`/api/static. No session → redirect to `/sign-in`. Signed in → fetch the user via `clerkClient().users.getUser()` (this fork runs Proxy on the Node runtime, so a Backend API call here is fine) and check the email against `isAllowedEmail()`. Not allowed → redirect to `/not-authorized`. Visiting `/sign-in` while already signed in redirects to `/` or `/not-authorized` depending on the check.
  - `src/lib/auth.ts` — `isAllowedEmail(email)`, reads `ALLOWED_EMAIL` from env (case-insensitive compare).
  - `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/{page.tsx,sign-in-form.tsx}` — custom Card with a "Continue with Google" button. Uses `useSignIn` from **`@clerk/nextjs/legacy`** (this Clerk version, 7.x, defaults `useSignIn`/`useSignUp` to a new signals/"Future" API with a different shape — `signIn.sso()` instead of `signIn.authenticateWithRedirect()`; went with the legacy import since it's the well-documented, unambiguous classic flow).
  - `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/sso-callback/page.tsx` — mounts Clerk's `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` to complete the OAuth redirect.
  - `src/app/(auth)/not-authorized/{page.tsx,sign-out-button.tsx}` — same `Empty` component pattern as `not-found.tsx`, plus a sign-out button.
  - `src/components/user-menu.tsx` — avatar + dropdown (email label, sign out) in the app header, replacing Clerk's `<UserButton>`.
- **Route groups**: split `src/app` into `(app)` (the existing sidebar shell — Dashboard/Contacts/Emails/Import/Settings, unchanged URLs) and `(auth)` (bare centered layout, no sidebar) so the sign-in/not-authorized screens don't render inside the app chrome. Root `layout.tsx` now only holds providers (`ClerkProvider`/`ThemeProvider`/`TooltipProvider`/`Toaster`); the sidebar + header moved into `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`. This is a pure directory move — no URLs changed — but double-check any hardcoded `@/app/...` import paths if you add more cross-page imports (one existing one, `compose-email.tsx` → `contacts/actions`, needed updating to `@/app/(app)/contacts/actions`).
- **Caveats**:
  - The email-allowlist check happens only in `proxy.ts`, not duplicated in Server Actions/DAL. Per Next's own auth guide, a Proxy matcher change or a Server Function moved to an unmatched route could silently lose this protection — worth adding a defense-in-depth check (e.g. a shared `requireAllowedUser()` called from actions) if this ever needs to be hardened further.
  - No custom session-token claims configured in the Clerk Dashboard, so the email check costs one Backend API call (`users.getUser`) per request to a protected route. Fine at single-user scale; if this matters later, add an `email` claim to the session token in Clerk's dashboard (Sessions → customize) and read it from `sessionClaims` instead.
  - `src/app/not-found.tsx` stayed at the root (outside both route groups), so it no longer renders with the sidebar/header — root `layout.tsx` lost that chrome in this change (see above). It still renders fine as a standalone centered `Empty` card, just without the app shell around it. Move it into `(app)` if the sidebar-visible 404 look matters more than a one-line handoff note.
  - `.env.local` already had Clerk keys but no `ALLOWED_EMAIL` — added `aryan.kumar@strideone.in`. `.env.example` documents the var with a placeholder (Clerk keys still aren't in `.env.example`, matching how it already was before this change).

## 404 page

- **What**: `src/app/not-found.tsx` — renders inside the existing root layout (so the sidebar/header still show), using the same `Empty` component pattern as the Import screen's pre-upload state, with a link back to the Dashboard. Standard App Router `not-found.js` convention, not the newer experimental `global-not-found.js` (that one's for apps with multiple root layouts, which this isn't).
  - **Superseded**: since the auth gate above moved the sidebar/header out of the root layout and into `(app)/layout.tsx`, this page no longer renders with the app chrome — see the caveats above.

## Contacts replace Companies as the primary outreach entity

- **Why**: cold outreach targets *people* (HR/recruiters), not companies — a company can have many contacts, and email is the real unique identifier, not company name. Everything that used to model "one company = one email" now models "many contacts, each optionally belonging to one company."
- **Setup required**: this changes the schema shape (not just adds columns), so run `npm run db:push` and **choose to drop/recreate `companies`/create `contacts` when prompted** — by agreement, existing test data in these tables is not being migrated, just reset.
- **Schema** (`src/db/schema.ts`):
  - `companies` is now a lookup/grouping entity only — dropped `email` and `status` (a company is never emailed directly, and outreach status is a per-contact thing now, not per-company).
  - New `contacts` table is the primary entity: `email` is `notNull().unique()` (the real identifier), plus `name`, `title`, `phone`, `companyId` (FK to `companies`, nullable), `status` (moved here from companies, default `"new"`), `notes`, `source`, `raw` JSON catch-all.
  - `emails.companyId` → `emails.contactId`.
- **Import** (`src/app/import/actions.ts`, now `approveContacts` instead of `approveCompanies`):
  - Field aliases split into contact fields (name/email/title/phone/notes) and company fields (company name/website/industry/location) — previously "Name" was treated as the *company's* name; now it's the *person's* name, and a company is only recognized via an explicit "Company"/"Organization"/"Employer"-style column.
  - Company matching is by **normalized name** (lowercased, common suffixes like "Inc."/"LLC"/"Corp" stripped, punctuation/whitespace collapsed) — curated HR lists commonly spell the same company differently across rows ("Acme" vs "Acme Inc."), so exact-string matching would silently create duplicate companies. This is best-effort, not fuzzy matching — genuinely different spellings that don't share a normalized form will still create separate companies.
  - Contacts are deduped by email via `onConflictDoNothing` — re-importing a sheet with a contact that already exists just skips that row (existing data isn't overwritten). Company info (website/industry/location) is only set when a company is first created, not merged in from later rows that mention the same company with more detail.
  - Returns `{ inserted, skippedNoEmail, skippedDuplicate }` instead of `{ inserted, skipped }`.
- **Pages**: `/companies` is gone; `/contacts` replaces it (same nav slot, renamed, new icon) — lists contacts with a `companyName` column (via a join), row selection, and the same "Send Email" dialog pattern as before (`src/app/contacts/actions.ts`'s `sendContactEmails`). The dialog no longer needs to warn about "no email on file" — every contact has one, by schema.
  - `/emails`'s recipient picker now lists contacts (label shows name, email, and company for context) instead of companies, and sends via `sendContactEmails`.
- **Explicitly deferred** (per discussion — these are real requirements but would have made this change too large to land at once):
  - Dynamic/merge-field email content (e.g. `{{company}}`, `{{contactName}}` in subject/body).
  - Preventing a duplicate *initial* outreach email to the same contact (with an eventual cooldown-based override, e.g. "allow re-sending after 45 days").
  - Threaded follow-ups (would need to capture and store each send's `Message-ID` to set `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers on the next email in the same thread).

## Test Email (Settings)

- **What**: `/settings` (the sidebar "Settings" link, which previously 404'd — no page existed for it yet) now has a landing page linking to `/settings/test-email`, a bare send-to-anyone form (To/Subject/Message) for verifying SMTP works, independent of Companies entirely. Not logged to the `emails` table — this is a throwaway smoke test, not outreach history.
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/settings/page.tsx` — minimal settings index (just one card linking to Test Email for now).
  - `src/app/settings/test-email/page.tsx` + `test-email-form.tsx` + `actions.ts` — the form and its `sendTestEmail(to, subject, body)` Server Action, a thin wrapper directly around `sendMail()` from `src/lib/mailer.ts` (no Companies/DB involved at all).
- **Caveats**:
  - Uses the same single global SMTP account as everything else — there's no way to test a *different* SMTP config from here without changing `.env.local`.
  - If email sending ever grows a second provider (e.g. Gmail API via OAuth scopes through Clerk), this page's only dependency is `sendMail()`'s signature (`{ to, subject, text }`) — swapping the implementation inside `mailer.ts` wouldn't require touching this page.

## Dedicated "Send Email" page (superseded — recipients are now Contacts, see above)

- **What**: new `/emails` page (own sidebar nav item, "Emails") — a full-page compose experience: search/multi-select recipients from any company that has an email on file, write a subject + message, and send. Independent of and in addition to the existing "Send Email" dialog on `/companies` (that one's still there for quickly emailing rows you've already selected in the table); this page is for composing from scratch without needing to go through Companies first.
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/emails/page.tsx` — Server Component, fetches `{ id, name, email }` for every company with a non-null email (`export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, same reasoning as `/companies`: must never serve a stale list).
  - `src/app/emails/compose-email.tsx` — the form. Recipient picker uses the shadcn `Combobox` in `multiple` mode for search/select, but renders the selected recipients as removable `Badge`s itself rather than using `Combobox`'s chips sub-components (`ComboboxChips`/`ComboboxChip`/`ComboboxChipRemove`) — those rely on some internal index/context wiring I couldn't fully verify was correct without the ability to check base-ui's live docs, so I opted for the version I could verify is correct. Revisit if a future feature calls for chips-inside-the-input specifically. Sending reuses the existing `sendCompanyEmails` Server Action from `/companies` unchanged — no logic duplicated.
  - `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` — added the "Emails" nav item.
- **Caveats**:
  - Only companies with an email on file appear as selectable recipients (no way to email an ad-hoc address that isn't already a Company).
  - Same plain-text-only, sequential-send, single-global-SMTP-account caveats as the section below apply here too, since both paths go through the same `sendCompanyEmails` action.

## Send email to Companies (SMTP + app password) (superseded — this is now /contacts + sendContactEmails, see above)

- **What**: on `/companies`, select one or more rows and click "Send Email" to open a compose dialog (subject + message body, plain text). Sends individually to each selected company's email address (not one email CC'ing everyone) via a personal SMTP account + app password — no OAuth/Clerk email scopes involved, this is the "simple approach for now." Every send attempt (success or failure) is logged to a new `emails` table.
- **Setup required before this works**:
  1. Add `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME` to `.env.local` (see `.env.example` — defaults are filled in for Gmail). `SMTP_PASSWORD` is a Gmail **app password** (Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords), not your normal login password — app passwords require 2FA to be enabled on the account.
  2. Run `npm run db:push` again — the schema changed (new `email` column on `companies`, new `emails` table).
- **Files**:
  - `src/db/schema.ts` — added `email` (nullable text) to `companies`; new `emails` table logging every send attempt (`companyId`, `to`, `subject`, `body`, `status: "sent" | "failed"`, `error`, `createdAt`) — this is the data future follow-up/template features can build on.
  - `src/lib/mailer.ts` — `sendMail({ to, subject, text })`, a lazily-created pooled `nodemailer` SMTP transporter (reused across sends in the same process instead of reconnecting per email).
  - `src/app/companies/actions.ts` — `sendCompanyEmails(companyIds, subject, body)` Server Action. Re-fetches the companies by ID from the DB (doesn't trust client-supplied email strings), skips any with no email on file, sends **sequentially** (not `Promise.all`) to stay well under Gmail's SMTP rate limits, and logs each attempt regardless of outcome.
  - `src/app/companies/send-email-dialog.tsx` — the compose dialog (`react-hook-form`, no `zod`/resolver — the form is just two required text fields, didn't need schema validation glue for that). Shows the resolved recipient count and warns if some selected companies have no email and will be skipped.
  - `src/app/companies/companies-table.tsx` — turned on `enableRowSelection`, added an `email` column, and added the "Send Email" button (enabled once ≥1 row is selected) that opens the dialog.
  - `src/app/import/actions.ts` — added `email` to `FIELD_ALIASES` so future spreadsheet imports auto-populate it (aliases: "Email", "Email Address", "Contact Email", "Mail").
- **Caveats**:
  - Plain text only — no HTML/rich formatting, no attachments, no templates yet (that's the next feature).
  - Sequential sends mean a large selection will take a while (one SMTP round-trip per recipient) — fine at personal-CRM scale, would need rethinking (e.g. a background job/queue) at real bulk-email volume.
  - Selection doesn't auto-clear after sending, same as the existing Import-screen caveat below — `DataTable` still has no reset-selection API.
  - Single global SMTP account for the whole app (env vars, not per-user settings) — matches this being a personal tool; would need real per-user credential storage if this ever became multi-tenant.

## Database + Companies list (import → approve → persist) (superseded — /companies no longer exists, replaced by /contacts, see above)

- **What**: the Import screen's row selection (checkboxes) now feeds a real "Import to Companies" action. Selecting rows and clicking the button maps each row's columns onto a `companies` Postgres table (via Drizzle) and inserts them; a new `/companies` page (already in the sidebar) lists everything that's been approved so far, using the same `DataTable`.
- **Setup required before this works**:
  1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in a real Postgres connection string.
  2. Run `npm run db:push` to create the `companies` table (or `npm run db:generate` first if you want a migration file instead of a direct push).
  3. `npm run db:studio` opens Drizzle Studio to browse the table if useful.
  - Note: `drizzle-kit` runs outside the Next.js runtime, so by itself it only auto-loads a plain `.env` file — not `.env.local`. `drizzle.config.ts` now calls `@next/env`'s `loadEnvConfig()` first to replicate Next's own `.env.local` loading, so `db:push`/`db:studio`/`db:generate` all see the same `DATABASE_URL` the app does.
- **Files**:
  - `drizzle.config.ts` — drizzle-kit config (schema path, Postgres dialect, reads `DATABASE_URL`)
  - `src/db/schema.ts` — `companies` table: fixed core columns (`name` required, `website`, `industry`, `location`, `status` defaulting to `"new"`, `notes`, `source`) plus a `raw` `jsonb` catch-all column for any imported spreadsheet columns that don't map to a known field
  - `src/db/index.ts` — Drizzle client singleton (reused across dev hot-reloads so we don't leak Postgres connections)
  - `src/app/import/actions.ts` — `approveCompanies(rows, source)` Server Action. Maps each row's column headers to a Company field by normalized-name matching (e.g. "Company Name"/"Organization" → `name`, "Website"/"URL" → `website`, etc.); anything unmatched goes into `raw`. Rows with no recognizable name column are skipped and reported back, not silently dropped.
  - `src/app/companies/page.tsx` + `companies-table.tsx` — Server Component fetches `companies` ordered by newest first and hands it to a small client component that defines the `ColumnDef`s (website renders as a link, status as a `Badge`) and renders `DataTable`. Marked `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` so it never serves a stale build-time cache of company data.
  - `src/components/data-table/data-table.tsx` — added an `onSelectedRowsChange` callback prop so a consumer (the Import page) can read which rows are currently checked, without `DataTable` needing to know anything about what happens with that selection.
  - Added a `<Toaster />` (sonner) to the root layout so `approveCompanies`'s result can surface as a toast.
  - `src/lib/spreadsheet.ts` — `serializeSpreadsheetRow()` converts any `Date` cells to ISO strings before a row crosses the Client → Server Action boundary. This Next.js version rejects non-plain-object arguments to Server Functions (`Date` included), so a row from a date-containing spreadsheet column would otherwise throw at the `approveCompanies` call. The Import page calls this right before invoking the action; `actions.ts`'s `ImportRow` type (`SerializedSpreadsheetCell`) no longer allows `Date` at all, so this can't regress silently.
  - `src/components/data-table/select-all-banner.tsx` — Gmail/Notion-style "select all across pages" prompt. The header checkbox only ever selects the current page (TanStack default); once a full page is checked, a banner offers "Select all N rows" (everything matching the current filters, not just this page) and, once that's done, "Clear selection". Purely additive — only renders when `enableRowSelection` is on, so it's a no-op for `/companies` (read-only, no selection).
- **Caveats**:
  - Column-to-field mapping is v1/best-effort auto-matching by normalized header name — no manual mapping UI yet. Revisit if imported sheets commonly use header names the aliases list doesn't cover (`src/app/import/actions.ts`'s `FIELD_ALIASES`).
  - After a successful import, the Import screen's row selection isn't automatically cleared (no reset API exposed on `DataTable` yet) — you can keep selecting/importing more rows or click "Upload another file" to start over.
  - `postgres` npm package + `pg`-style connection is used (not an edge/serverless HTTP driver), so this assumes a normal long-lived Postgres connection is reachable from wherever this runs.
  - `drizzle-kit` (dev-only migration CLI) currently pulls in a moderate, dev-only `esbuild` vulnerability transitively — accepted since it's never part of the production bundle.
  - Server Actions have a default payload size limit (~1MB) — approving an extremely large selection of rows at once could hit that; not handled specially yet.

## Spreadsheet import (preview only)

- **What**: `/import` page — upload a `.csv`/`.xlsx`/`.xls` file, it's parsed client-side and rendered as a sortable, filterable, paginated table. Added "Import" to the sidebar nav.
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/import/page.tsx` — the page (upload UI + state), builds `ColumnDef`s from the parsed column types
  - `src/lib/spreadsheet.ts` — `parseSpreadsheetFile(file)`, uses `xlsx` (SheetJS) to read the first sheet into `{ columns: { key, type }[], rows }`. `type` is inferred per column (`"string" | "number" | "date"`) by sampling cell values (real `Date` objects from Excel, or regex-matched numeric/date strings from CSV).
  - `src/components/data-table/` — reusable `DataTable<TData, TValue>` abstraction over TanStack Table + shadcn's `Table` primitive, split into focused modules instead of one large file:
    - `data-table.tsx` — table shell: state, column resolution, renders header/body/toolbar/pagination
    - `filter-fns.ts` — filter value types, the three custom filter functions (text/number/date) + `ColumnMeta`/`FilterFns` module augmentation
    - `sort-menu.tsx`, `filter-menu.tsx`, `view-menu.tsx` — the toolbar popovers (Sort, Filter, column-visibility "View")
    - `column-header.tsx` — the clickable sortable header cell
    - `date-picker.tsx` — `Popover` + `Calendar` date picker used by date filters (not a native `<input type="date">`)
    - `drag-handle.tsx`, `utils.ts` — shared grip handle + `getColumnLabel`/`reorder`/`useDragReorder` helpers
    - `select-column.tsx` — `createSelectColumn()`, the row-selection checkbox column
    - `index.ts` — barrel export, so `@/components/data-table` still resolves the same as before
  - Linear-style toolbar: a "Sort" button and a "Filter" button (each with a count badge) open a popover to add/edit/remove/reorder criteria — no inline per-column filter row. Both lists support drag-to-reorder via a grip handle (native HTML5 drag-and-drop, no new dependency). A "View" button toggles column visibility. Column headers stay clickable for sort (no icon shown until sorted or hovered, to stay uncluttered), synced to the same sort state as the Sort popover — plain click sorts by just that column, **Shift+click adds it to the existing multi-sort** (this is TanStack's default `isMultiSortEvent` behavior, unmodified); a tooltip on the header spells this out since it isn't otherwise discoverable.
  - Filtering is opt-in per column via `meta.filterVariant: "text" | "number" | "date"` on the `ColumnDef`; `DataTable` derives the right filter function and operator set (contains / =,>,<,between / is,before,after,between) automatically.
  - Row selection is opt-in via `<DataTable enableRowSelection />` (on for `/import`). Adds a checkbox column (header checkbox supports indeterminate state), highlights selected rows, and switches the pagination footer from "N rows" to "X of Y row(s) selected". Extended the shared `Checkbox` (`src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx`) with an `indeterminate` prop (dash icon + primary-color fill) since it's a generically useful state, not just for this table.
- **Caveats**:
  - The parsed preview itself still isn't persisted (parsed rows live in component state and vanish on refresh/navigation) — only rows you explicitly select and approve via "Import to Companies" (see the section above) get saved.
  - Only the first sheet of a workbook is read.
  - Column type inference is a best-effort heuristic (all non-empty cells in a column must match to count as number/date); mixed-type columns fall back to `"string"`.
  - `xlsx@0.18.5` (the npm-registry build) has two known unpatched vulns (prototype pollution, ReDoS) since SheetJS moved patched releases off npm to their own CDN. Accepted as low-risk since only the user uploads files to their own instance — revisit if this ever accepts files from anyone else.
  - Only one filter criterion per column at a time (matches TanStack's column-filter model); the Sort/Filter menus disable columns already in use to prevent duplicates.
  - Drag reorder uses the browser's native HTML5 drag-and-drop (`draggable`/`onDragStart`/`onDrop`) rather than a library like dnd-kit — no new dependency, but no touch-drag support and no drag preview styling beyond the browser default.
